Following Nystrom's  Crafting Interpreters starting at Chapter 14

(Almost) all my professional career in software, about 46 years, I've seen
compilers and interpreters as more like magic than any other aspect of computer
science.  I had one assigmrent, about 17 years ago that caused me to discover
the "dragon book",  enough to cause me to add to my bucket list "grok
interpreters" and now I'm working down my bucket list.  I started this several
months ago but "life got in the way", so here we go.  Again. Wish me luck.

FWIW:  I have my editoor configured for 80-charactyer columns.  Also, I will be preferring my own style to Nystrom's, so expect some visual differences.
